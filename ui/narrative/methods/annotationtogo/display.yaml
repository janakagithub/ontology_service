    <p>This method translates existing genome functional annotations and/or ontology term assignments into available ontology term translations in KBase or custom ontology term translations. Currently KBase supports  Enzyme Commission (EC) to Gene Ontology (GO), UniProtKB-Keyword to GO, InterPro to GO, SEED Subsystem Ontology (SSO) to GO and user uploaded custom translations (see Data Upload and Download Guide (hyperlink) for details on Ontology Translation upload). Reference ontology translation tables are available in KBase for the supported methods described above. The EC 2 GO, UniProtKB-Keyword to GO and InterPro to GO references tables are updated monthly from EBIâ€™s <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA/ElectronicAnnotationMethods">Electronic Annotation Resources</a></p>.
    <p>EC to GO maps EC numbers genome annotation function descriptions to GO terms with the ec2go ontology translation table. EC numbers are manually curated into the description line of Swiss-Prot entries and added automatically to TrEMBL entries. Mappings between EC and the corresponding GO terms are automatically made using the EC cross-references in the GO Molecular Function ontology. This method has been evaluated at up to 100% accurate.</p> 
    <p>UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries are assigned keywords manually based on literature and sequence analysis checks by curators. Keywords are mapped to corresponding GO terms in the uniprotkb_kw2go translation table, which was originally constructed manually by MGI curators and is now maintained by the UniProt-GOA team at EBI. The mappings are then transitively assigned at each UniProt-GOA release. GO annotations using this technique will receive the evidence code Inferred from Electronic Annotation (IEA).</p>
